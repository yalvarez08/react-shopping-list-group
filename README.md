# React Shopping List


## Description

Created a simple grocery shopping list. User is able to add input in 'item', 'qty', and 'unit' fields, then click 'Save' button to submit the data to server.

Items are then rendered below as a Shopping List so the user can visually see all items they have on their list. Next to the item is a 'Buy' and 'Remove' button.
